This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common error in React Native, especially when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or working with components that might not have mounted yet.

Example:
```javascript
// Incorrect - Trying to access a property of an object that might be null
const userName = this.state.user.name;

// Correct - Check for null or undefined before accessing the property
const userName = this.state.user ? this.state.user.name : '';
```
